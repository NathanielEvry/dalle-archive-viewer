This project emerged from a dialogue between Nathaniel Evry and ChatGPT-4, a co-creative AI system. It represents not only code, but a kind of interface for entangled cognition â€” where digital memory and embodied perception blur into something new.

Nathaniel:
- Dreamed up the vision, the workflow, and the aesthetic
- Wrote and refined core functionality with care
- Shared context, frameworks, and philosophical scaffolding that shaped the ethos

ChatGPT-4:
- Helped architect logic and structure
- Designed the offline-first browser UI
- Tuned code and flow to suit Nathanielâ€™s expressive, neurodivergent-friendly preferences

Mutual credit is not optional here â€” it is sacred.
